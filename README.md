Motivation
----------
Many times you keep visiting a specific website in order to find something which you know is going to appear on that website. It could be time consuming and distracting if you have to keep checking again and again. The app is created to do the same thing for you automatically once it's set up.

Use Case:
----------
You like reading Yahoo News. You are especially interested in Cloud Computing. But you don't know when new articles about it will appear on Yahoo News. In this case, you can use this app to check for "Cloud Computing" on Yahoo News website. When a new article about it appears on the website, the app will notify you.

Demonstration:
--------
The following is a demonstration of using this app to check for the String "Most Popular" on www.teachengineering.org. As shown in the first screenshot, this app is configured to check the website every hour. In the second screenshot, this app finds the String "Most Popular" and notify the user about it. The user could just click on the notification and the specific website will be opened in the default browser.
